* Load the list of contacts
* Sends and receives messages
* Presence notifications work
* Message counters work
* Indicators for messages received/read (little check marks in messages)

Does not work yet:

* Modifying an existing account
* Contact discovery - can't find other people
* Deleting/muting topics and messages
* No offline mode
* Can't start new conversations
* No push notifications
